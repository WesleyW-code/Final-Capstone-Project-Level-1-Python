# Final-Capstone-Project-Level-1-Python

In this project i had to create a task manager which allows users to log in (only if username and password is correct) then add tasks, view all tasks, view own tasks or exit.
The admin has more options which are: register user , add tasks, view all tasks, view my tasks, generate reports, view statistics or exit.

- All usernames and passwords are saved to a text file (only the admin can add more users with requested passwords.)
- All tasks are added to a text file.

Admin privileges:

If the admin logs in a special menu will be presented.

- All usernames and passwords are saved to text file which only the admin can do.

- When register user is selected the admin wil be allowed to add a new user with a password (if the username already exists it will provide error message and then allow to change it.)

- When add tasks is selected a number of questions will be asked about the project and once filled in correctly it will store it to the text file.

- When view all tasks is selected all the tasks that there are will be shows on the terminal.

- When view my tasks is selected it will only show the tasks of the user that is logged in and will have each task numbered. It will then ask which task would you like to edit then the correct number should be entered. From there you can choose to either mark the task as complete or edit the details.

- When generate reports is selected information about the users will be generated to a text file calles User overview and information about the tasks will be generated to a text file called Tasks overview.

- When view statistics is selected the reports above will first be generated and then displayed on the terminal.

- When exit is selected the program will end.
